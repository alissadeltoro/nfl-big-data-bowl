{"cells":[{"source":"# NFL Big Data Bowl 2024: Tackling\n\nThis year's competition offers up a general goal — create metrics that assign value to elements of tackling. You can access the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data as in previous competitions. This year's player tracking includes data from Weeks 1-9 of the 2022 NFL season. Data will show the location, speed, and acceleration of all 22 players on the field, along with football location. Additional PFF scouting data and NFL advanced stats such as expected points and win probability are also included.\n\nYour challenge is generating actionable, practical, and novel insights from player tracking data corresponding to tackling. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Predictions of tackle time, probability, and/or location\n- Tackle range: angle of pursuit, speed and acceleration, closing speed\n- Player evaluation (e.g, yards saved, tackle value, missed tackles)\n- Credit assignment (e.g, one player makes a tackle because of another players, blocks shed, area of influence)\n- Tackle type (solo vs gang, open field vs in the trenches, etc)\n- Team and player roles and responsibilities (setting the edge, filling gaps, etc)\n\n_Coaching presentation track._ This track aims to analyze and present data in a submission designed for coaches. We encourage participants interested in this track to partner with a coach (or current/former player), though this isn’t required.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2d4bd3e3-71f7-4db9-b1e6-1100e24816d9"},{"source":"**Dashboard Objectives:**\n\nDefensive Stop Probability (For American Football): This metric assesses the likelihood of a player making a successful tackle based on their location, speed, and acceleration in proximity to the ball carrier. You can adapt this idea for soccer by redefining \"tackle\" as \"defensive intervention\" and using similar location, speed, and acceleration data.\n\n1. **Evaluate Defensive Player Performance in Crucial Tackling Situations:** The primary objective of the dashboard is to enable coaches to assess how defensive players perform in critical tackling situations in American football. These situations are defined based on the likelihood of a player making a successful tackle. Coaches should be able to understand which defensive players excel in specific tackle situations and who may need improvement.\n\n2. **Enhance In-Game Decision-Making:** Coaches should be able to use the dashboard during American football matches to make real-time decisions regarding player rotations and strategic adjustments. For example, they might analyze the performance of specific defensive players in critical tackle situations and decide whether to make substitutions.\n\n3. **Identify Strengths and Weaknesses:** The dashboard should help coaches identify the strengths and weaknesses of defensive players in different tackle situations. Coaches should be able to view metrics that highlight areas where a player excels and areas for improvement when it comes to making successful tackles.\n\n**Dashboard Features:**\n\n1. **Tackle Situation Selection:** Coaches should be able to choose from a range of tackle situations for analysis. These situations are defined based on the likelihood of a player making a successful tackle. Coaches can select specific scenarios that align with critical defensive moments during a game.\n\n2. **Player Selection:** Coaches should have the option to select specific defensive players or player groups (e.g., positions) for analysis. This allows coaches to focus on individual players or assess entire units in terms of their tackle performance.\n\n3. **Metric Display:** The dashboard should display key metrics related to defensive stop probability. Metrics might include tackle success rates, historical performance trends in specific tackle situations, and comparative data for selected players or tackle scenarios.\n\n4. **Interactive Visualizations:** The dashboard should feature interactive visualizations that allow coaches to explore the data. Visual elements may include charts, heatmaps, tables, and trend graphs that provide insights into defensive stop probabilities.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4c864274-0932-4d60-a71a-6ec81f4fdc92"},{"source":"Player Characteristics: It considers the physical attributes and capabilities of the defensive player, such as their speed and acceleration. These attributes influence their ability to reach and tackle the ball carrier effectively.\n\nPlayer Location: The location of the defensive player in relation to the ball carrier is a critical factor. It assesses how close the defender is to the ball carrier and whether they are in a favorable position to make a tackle.\n\nProximity to the Ball Carrier: This metric evaluates the proximity of the defensive player to the ball carrier at a specific point in time. It considers factors like the distance between the two players and their relative trajectories.\n\nTackle Success Prediction: The Defensive Stop Probability metric uses statistical models to predict the probability of a tackle being successful. The prediction is based on historical data, player attributes, and the current in-game situation.\n\nGame Situation: It takes into account the context of the game, including the down, distance to the first down or goal, field position, and other situational variables. Different game situations can affect the probability of a successful tackle.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2e8ce58e-506e-4e03-96ac-a5227d493380"},{"source":"## Data Pre-processing","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cc916bb0-94b9-4e92-aad4-67e097c078ca"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Import CSV files into python\ngames_df = pd.read_csv(\"games.csv\")\nplayer_df = pd.read_csv(\"players.csv\")\nplays_df = pd.read_csv(\"plays.csv\")\ntackles_df = pd.read_csv(\"tackles.csv\")\nweek1_df = pd.read_csv(\"tracking_week_1.csv\", low_memory = False)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":1803,"lastExecutedAt":1697406823596,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Import CSV files into python\ngames_df = pd.read_csv(\"games.csv\")\nplayer_df = pd.read_csv(\"players.csv\")\nplays_df = pd.read_csv(\"plays.csv\")\ntackles_df = pd.read_csv(\"tackles.csv\")\nweek1_df = pd.read_csv(\"tracking_week_1.csv\", low_memory = False)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"5664da5e-ba45-4d18-b366-7d9692e68637","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"source":"games_df.head()","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":50,"lastExecutedAt":1697406823647,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"games_df.head()","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":193,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"57b0b86c-1421-4681-baf4-fe28e25c9245","execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"gameId","type":"integer"},{"name":"season","type":"integer"},{"name":"week","type":"integer"},{"name":"gameDate","type":"string"},{"name":"gameTimeEastern","type":"string"},{"name":"homeTeamAbbr","type":"string"},{"name":"visitorTeamAbbr","type":"string"},{"name":"homeFinalScore","type":"integer"},{"name":"visitorFinalScore","type":"integer"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":[{"index":0,"gameId":2022090800,"season":2022,"week":1,"gameDate":"09/08/2022","gameTimeEastern":"20:20:00","homeTeamAbbr":"LA","visitorTeamAbbr":"BUF","homeFinalScore":10,"visitorFinalScore":31},{"index":1,"gameId":2022091100,"season":2022,"week":1,"gameDate":"09/11/2022","gameTimeEastern":"13:00:00","homeTeamAbbr":"ATL","visitorTeamAbbr":"NO","homeFinalScore":26,"visitorFinalScore":27},{"index":2,"gameId":2022091101,"season":2022,"week":1,"gameDate":"09/11/2022","gameTimeEastern":"13:00:00","homeTeamAbbr":"CAR","visitorTeamAbbr":"CLE","homeFinalScore":24,"visitorFinalScore":26},{"index":3,"gameId":2022091102,"season":2022,"week":1,"gameDate":"09/11/2022","gameTimeEastern":"13:00:00","homeTeamAbbr":"CHI","visitorTeamAbbr":"SF","homeFinalScore":19,"visitorFinalScore":10},{"index":4,"gameId":2022091103,"season":2022,"week":1,"gameDate":"09/11/2022","gameTimeEastern":"13:00:00","homeTeamAbbr":"CIN","visitorTeamAbbr":"PIT","homeFinalScore":20,"visitorFinalScore":23}]},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"       gameId  season  week  ... visitorTeamAbbr homeFinalScore visitorFinalScore\n0  2022090800    2022     1  ...
